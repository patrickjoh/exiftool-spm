# ExifToolSPM

`prebuilt` is the binary distribution branch for `ExifToolSPM`.
It keeps the Swift wrapper and bundled Perl resources in this repository, and downloads the embedded bridge as a prebuilt XCFramework from GitHub Releases.

## Usage

```swift
.package(
    url: "https://github.com/lbr77/exiftool-spm",
    branch: "prebuilt"
)
```

Then depend on `ExifTool` from your target.
